# skill-cards

This project aims to introduce myself to an employer. There are random surcfaces of my person related to the (web) development. The website is available at [https://natural-coding.github.io/skill-cards](https://natural-coding.github.io/skill-cards)

It uses so-called Masonry layout to display cards. Actually it is my first complicated frontend project.
